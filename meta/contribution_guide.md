# Contribution Guide
**How to contribute to Open Novel**

## Step 1. Clone the Repo.
The first step will be downloading a copy of the github repository onto your computer. You can follow these guides here:

## Step 2. Create a new branch from main.
Once you have the repository you will want to create your own branch. When you are ready to push some changes through, having your own branch will allow us to direct where and how any changes are being delivered to the main branch.

## Step 3. Push changes
Once you have made some edits to your branch, you need to push them. This can be done a number of ways.

## Step 4. Create a pull request
Once you have made all of the additions and edits for this specific change, navigate back to the github site. You should see green notice that your branch has recent pushes. You can just create a pull request from that button. If you don't see that then follow the below steps.

First thing you are going to do is make sure your pull request is being pushed into the experimental branch and not the main branch. We will be using a tiered promotion and vetting process, so not all changes should instantly be pushed to main where things are canon.

Now you can give your pull request a title and description. Keep it simple and easy to understand the general idea of the changes being made at a quick glance. Here is where you can let the moderators know how to credit you if the changes get pushed to main. If you do not note how you would like to appear in the contributors file then your github username will be used in it's place. 

Then assign it to yourself on the right hand side of the page.

Click the green button at the bottom of the page saying create pull request. At this point the pull request is now made and a moderator can now review your changes and approve your request to move into experimental.

## Step 5. Review Process
A moderator will then be notified of your push and will have a chance to give your pull request a review before it moves to experimental. At this time they will provide comments and feedback on any of the additions or edits you have submitted. If you receive any feedback, this does not mean the changes were flat out rejected. The PR is still open and you can continue to make commits to the branch which will automatically be added to the PR.

Once you have worked with the reviewers and changes look good then the PR will be pushed to the experimental branch.

**Note: This does not mean that your changes are canon or you are a contributor. Only once your changes have moved from the experimental branch to the main branch will your name be added to the contributors file.**
