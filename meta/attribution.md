# Attribution Policy
This project is a collaborative story telling project entirely open source. As such we want to attribute credit to the amazing people who have chosen to help add to this project.

Attribution will be provided in a way that is fair, scalable, and consistent with open source practices.

## How Attribution Works
- Authorship and contribution history are recorded in Git commit history.
- Contributors whose work is merged into the main branch and considered canon are eligible to be listed in [contributors.md](meta/contributors.md).
- Depending on how large the project gets, minor contributions may be credited via git commit history only.
- Contributors may request a preferred display name or pseudonym in contributors.md

## Scope of Attribution
- Being merged into `experimental` does not guarantee attribution.
- Only canonical content merged into `main` is considered for contributor listing.
- Forks and derivative works must provide attribution to this project as required by CC BY-SA.

## External Use
When this work is reused externally (books, games, adaptations),
appropriate attribution should include:
- The project name
- A link to the original repository
- A reference to the CC BY-SA 4.0 license

## Disputes
Attribution disputes are handled by project maintainers.
Decisions are guided by this policy and Git history.
