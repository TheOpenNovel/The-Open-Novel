# The-Open-Novel
Welcome to The Open Novel. This idea came from many stories having severe disappointing arcs and endings with fan theories seeming significantly better. This is a way to test if the public audience truly can write a better story than professionals. All plotlines, characters, settings, and even chapters will be written entirely by the community.
