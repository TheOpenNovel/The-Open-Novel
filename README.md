# The Open Novel

_A collaboratively written, open‑source novel built on GitHub._

The Open Novel is an experiment in community storytelling. Many times movies, t.v. shows, and novels feel like community created fan theories are better written and fleshed out than what was actually produced. This sparked the idea of creating an open-source community written and maintained novel.

Anyone can read the story. Anyone can write the story.

----------

## 📖 What This Is

- A novel written by many contributors
- An experimental project to see if a community can actually come together and write a better story than industry professionals.

This is not a free‑for‑all wiki. It’s a collaboratively edited book.

----------

## 🧭 How the Story Is Organized

-   `main` branch → **Canon** (official story)
    
-   `experimental` branch → **Drafts, alternatives, and bold ideas**
    
-   Forks → **Parallel interpretations** (all valid, all open)
    

Directory overview:

```
/story/        → Chapters and prose
/lore/         → Characters, worldbuilding, timeline
/meta/         → Canon rules, style guide, attribution

```

1.  Clone the repo
    
2.  Create a branch for your change
    
3.  Write or edit prose
    
4.  Open a pull request (base set to `experimental`)

## 🧠 Canon & Editorial Control

-   The `main` branch represents **official canon**
    
-   Maintainers decide what becomes canon
    
-   Not all PRs will be merged
    
-   Rejections ≠ invalid ideas
    

Forks and non‑canon branches are encouraged.
