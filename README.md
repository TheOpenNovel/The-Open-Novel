# The-Open-Novel
Welcome to The Open Novel. This idea came from many stories having disappointing arcs and endings with fan theories always feeling more well written and fleshed out. This is a way to test if the public could truly write a better story than professionals. All plot-lines, characters, settings, and even chapters will be written entirely by the community.
